# 🚌 TranCIT - Student Transit Guide

**TranCIT - Student Transit Guide** is a mobile-responsive web application designed to revolutionize the commuting experience for students in Cebu City. It specifically targets freshmen, transferees, and non-local students who are often unfamiliar with the local Public Utility Jeepney (PUJ) system. Our mission is to transform a typically complex and anxiety-inducing daily task into a straightforward, efficient, and stress-free journey.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Navigating Cebu's jeepney system presents significant challenges due to:
- **Alphanumeric route codes** (e.g., 13C, 04L)
- **Reliance on informal landmark-based directions**
- **Scarcity of comprehensive, accurate digital mapping tools**

This results in:
- Students getting lost
- Taking inefficient routes
- Overpaying for fares
- Experiencing undue stress and safety concerns

## ✨ Key Features

The Student Transit Guide provides a robust set of tools to address these issues:
- **Route Finder**: Generates clear, step-by-step jeepney commute instructions between any specified origin and destination within Cebu City
- **Jeepney Code Translator**: A searchable database that deciphers local jeepney route shorthand, explaining what codes like "13C" signify
- **Fare Estimator**: An automated calculator providing accurate estimated jeepney fares based on the generated route and distance
- **Landmark-Based Navigation**: Integrates prominent city landmarks into directions for intuitive and easier wayfinding
- **Newbie Mode**: Offers a simplified interface with more detailed, beginner-friendly instructions, perfect for first-time commuters
- **Offline Route Saving**: Allows users to save generated routes for access even without an active internet connection
